    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Who doesn't like a beautifully poached egg? In the past, I would never be able to make poached eggs without everything falling apart. I couldn't understand how restaurants, diners, brunch places could always have these perfectly round poached eggs without egg whites flying all over the place.</p>
    <p>That was until I discovered the secret, and I'm here to share thsi with all of you! Keep on reading to see what I learned.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons of vinegar</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low</li>
            <li>While waiting for the water to boi, crack your egg into a small fine mesh sieve over a bowl. Swirl the egg in the sieve until all the liquidy egg whites have been removed. Then place the eggin a ramekin.</li>
            <li>Stir the vinegar into the water and create a vortex. Add the egg to the middle of the vortex and cook the egg for 3 minutes (timing is important here)</li>
            <li>Remove the egg with a slotted spoon and dab it on a paper towel to remove any excess water. Serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Alternative, if making the poached eggs for meal prep or ahead of times, transfer the cooked poached eggs to an ice water bath and refrigerate for a couple of days. When ready to serve, add boiling water to a bowl, then add the cold poached egg and submerge 20-30 seconds or until warmed through. Remove the poached egg with a slotted spoon, dab dry and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
